Top 10 Kubernetes Failures in Production 

Kubernetes is powerful — but misconfigurations can lead to major outages, even in mature production environments.
After working on multiple production clusters and postmortems, here are the most common K8s failures I’ve seen in my last 6 years with K8s:

- Missing Resource Limits
 Pods consume all resources, causing other pods to get evicted.
 Fix: Always set resources.requests and resources.limits.
- Improper Liveness/Readiness Probes
 Healthy pods get killed or unready pods receive traffic.
 Fix: Use appropriate probe types and tune thresholds.
- CrashLoopBackOff or OOMKilled
 App crashes repeatedly or exceeds memory limits.
 Fix: Check logs, adjust memory, fix startup bugs.
- RBAC Misconfigurations
 Permissions are either denied or overly permissive.
 Fix: Use the principle of least privilege with roles and bindings.
- Faulty Rolling Updates
 No healthy pods left due to misconfiguration.
 Fix: Set sane values for maxUnavailable and maxSurge.
- DNS Failures
 Services fail to resolve each other.
 Fix: Monitor CoreDNS and review dnsPolicy settings.
- Broken Ingress or Services
 Applications become unreachable due to incorrect configuration.
 Fix: Verify paths, ports, and service selectors.
- Node Pressure and Evictions
 Pods are evicted due to CPU, memory, or disk pressure.
 Fix: Use autoscaling and monitor node resource usage.
- Storage / PVC Issues
 Apps fail to mount volumes or experience data loss.
 Fix: Ensure storage classes are configured and access modes are correct.
- Unreadable ConfigMaps or Secrets
 Apps fail to start due to missing or misconfigured mounts.
 Fix: Validate YAML syntax and inspect mount paths.

Remember: Kubernetes is declarative, but not forgiving :)
