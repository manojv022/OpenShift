Great! Let's go over the **OpenShift CLI (`oc`) commands** in a **structured, beginner-friendly way**, so you can understand not just what they do, but **when and why** you use them.

## ðŸ”¹ What is `oc`?

`oc` is the **OpenShift Command Line Interface**, similar to `kubectl` in Kubernetes, but with **OpenShift-specific capabilities** like managing Builds, Routes, ImageStreams, and Projects.

## ðŸ§  Tip: Resources in OpenShift

You can use `oc get <resource>` for all these types:

| Resource       | Description              |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `pods` or `po` | Running containers       |
| `svc`          | Services                 |
| `rc`           | ReplicationControllers   |
| `deployment`   | Deployments              |
| `bc`           | BuildConfigs             |
| `is`           | ImageStreams             |
| `route`        | External access route    |
| `cm`           | ConfigMaps               |
| `secret`       | Secrets                  |
